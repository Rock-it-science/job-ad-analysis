# job-ad-analysis

Project for COSC 329 - Learning Analytics to scrape and analyze over 10'000 job ads

## Project Description

Scrape a job website (such as indeed.ca) for job postings with two or more specific job titles and one location. Then parse the text in the postings to analyze required skills. You'll need to think about how skills are defined and use existing NLP libraries to preprocess the texts. Make sure you do something beyond simple keyword or bag of words to recognize skills. Then, do some data analyses to visualize the most sought after skills for these jobs and how the skills are different between the two job titles you searched for.

Scrape 10,000+ job postings, identify 3+ NLP library functions you will use to preprocess the text, explain what each function does and why you chose them, extract skills from the text based on the output of your NLP preprocessing, explain how your extraction algorithm works (i.e., define what you consider to be skills in the text), show the top skills for each job title, compute the overlap between the skills of the two jobs (e.g., using the Bhattacharyya coefficient).
